- ⚡ About: JABtypes was assembled using the most advanced robotics technology that 1887 had to offer. He needs oiling twice a day and tends to careen rather than walk. His hit single "Paint Me, I'm Shiny" tore up the charts in 1967 and became the theme song for the movie "Spark Lagoo and The Flower Power Tower" in 1968. He has written, directed, and appeared in many of your oddest dreams. He used to be able to fly but after a most unfortunate collision with a nuclear power plant, he now exists every other minute, making most activities no longer feasible. One of his favorite activities is catching rain and throwing it back into the sky. One time, he mist.
